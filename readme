Introduction
Welcome to the Vehicle Builder App, a fun and interactive command-line application where you can create and customize vehicles by choosing from a variety of attributes such as color, make, model, weight, top speed, and more.

Once you’ve created your vehicle, you can control its movement—accelerate, decelerate, stop, turn, reverse, or tow—all from the command line!

The app is built using TypeScript and integrates several Node.js packages to create a seamless user experience.

Features
Interactive vehicle creation: Choose attributes like color, make, model, weight, top speed, towing capacity, tire brand, and more.
Vehicle control: Once your vehicle is built, you can start and control it with commands such as accelerate, decelerate, stop, turn, reverse, and tow.
Multiple vehicles: Create multiple vehicles and switch between them to control each one.
User-friendly interface: Built using inquirer, the app provides a smooth and intuitive terminal experience.
Detailed vehicle specs: Print out detailed specs of the vehicle(s) you've assembled.
Exit or Create Another Vehicle: Once you're done with one vehicle, you can exit the app or choose to create another vehicle.

Once the app is running, you will be prompted to follow a sequence of questions to create your vehicle. Here's how the flow works:
