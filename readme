## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Vehicle Builder and Control CLI App**, a fun and interactive command-line application where you can create and customize vehicles by choosing from a variety of attributes such as color, make, model, weight, top speed, and more.

Once you’ve created your vehicle, you can control its movement—accelerate, decelerate, stop, turn, reverse, or tow—all from the command line!

The app is built using **TypeScript** and integrates several **Node.js** packages to create a seamless user experience.
